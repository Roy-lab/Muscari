### MUSCARI (Multi-task Spectral Clustering AlgoRIthm)

<img align="left" width="350" src="http://pages.discovery.wisc.edu/~jshin/multi-species-proteome/muscari_cartoon.png"> Muscari is a new multi-task graph-based clustering algorithm developed for identification of gene co-expression network modules (or sub-networks) jointly across species from species-specific genome-wide co-expression networks, by using both the phylogenetic relationship between species and the graph-based nature of co-expression matrices. Muscari is based on the Arboretum-HiC (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0962-8) multi-task graph clustering algorithm, which defines each task as a spectral graph clustering problem, one for each species, and the the multi-task learning framework simultaneously searches for groups of genes that are interacting in multiple species while accounting for the phylogenetic relationship between species. Unlike Arboretum-HiC, Muscari inputs are gene expression matrices, which are converted into fully-connected weighted gene co-expression networks, i.e. every genes have edges with every other genes but differently weighted.
